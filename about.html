        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a junior at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. I major in computer science at Harvey Mudd College while pursuing a minor in mathematics. In addition to classes, I also serve on the Pitzer College Student Senate, work as the Production Editor for The Student Life (the on-campus newspaper), and TA for computer science at Harvey Mudd.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with my academic endeavours, I has also developed a passion for the arts. Within the realm of visual art, I especially love photography, in which I specialize in portraiture. I also enjoy shooting nature and urban landscapes, as well as developing film photography in the darkroom.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy graphic design and explore this mediums through both on-campus activities and personal projects, such as this website! With regards to performing art, I grew up learning the cello and currently perform and compete on the Tour Team of the Claremont Colleges Ballroom Dance Company.
        </p>
        <h2>My Photography</h2>
        <iframe align="right" width="340" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O31OZgnCoAw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            One area of photography that I have really enjoyed is taking photos and developing them in the darkroom. This includes learning how to shoot using an analog camera, creating contact sheets with the film, and then producing prints by mixing the developing chemicals and enlarging the nrgatives on photo paper. The process is shown in the video to the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a phototographer, my influences include:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://barbarakasten.net/" target="_blank">Barbara Kasten</a>'s abstract work</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz" target="_blank">Annie Leibovitz</a>'s portraiture</li>
                <li><a href="https://mangelsen.com/" target="_blank">Thomas D. Mangelsen</a>'s nature photography.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A main area of focus for me is my <a href="portrait.html">portrait photography</a>, for which I have done several senior and graduation photo shoots. To get a quote and arrange a time for a photo shoot, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
